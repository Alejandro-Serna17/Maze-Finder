# Maze Solver Program<br />
This repository contains a Java program to solve maze problems using recursive backtracking algorithms. The program allows users to interactively visualize and solve mazes on a graphical grid interface.<br />

## Overview<br />
The program consists of two main classes:<br />

- MazeTest: A graphical user interface (GUI) class that allows users to interact with the maze solving algorithms. It provides buttons to solve the maze, find the shortest path, and reset the maze for new trials.<br />

- Maze: A class that implements maze solving algorithms using recursive backtracking. It includes methods to find any path through the maze and the shortest path from a specified start to destination.<br />

## Setup and Usage<br />
### Prerequisites<br />
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.<br />
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor with JDK.<br />

## Running the Program<br />
1. Compile the Java files<br />

2. Run the MazeTest GUI<br />

3. Using the Maze Solver<br />

- Input Maze Dimensions: Upon launching the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for the maze grid.<br />
- Interactive GUI: Use the GUI buttons to solve the maze, find the shortest path, and reset the maze for new trials.<br />
- Solving Options:<br />
- SOLVE: Finds any path from the starting point to the destination.<br />
- SOLVE_SHORTEST: Finds the shortest path from the starting point to the destination.<br />
- RESET: Resets the maze to its original state for new trials.<br />
4. Interacting with the Maze<br />

- Toggle buttons on the maze grid to change their color.<br />
- Press SOLVE or SOLVE_SHORTEST after setting up the maze to find paths.<br />
- Follow on-screen prompts to enter starting and destination cell coordinates.<br />

Upon entering the dimensions, the GUI will display a grid where you can interactively toggle cells and use the SOLVE or SOLVE_SHORTEST buttons to find paths.<br />
